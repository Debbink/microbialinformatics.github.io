* This is what's called an IDE: integrated development environment
* It is important to note that you don't need RStudio to run R. I frequently do everything from the command line using a text editor
* The main window is made up of four panes: source code (up left), console (bot left), history/environment (up right), and display (bot right)
* There are a variety of widgets on the screen that you can explore throughout the semester
